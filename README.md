## About this project

My idea was that the user adds a dish to the page, adds the exact amounts of ingredients and the program calculates how much it would cost to make such a dish with the specified amount of ingredients. Various ingredients with their price for a given quantity should be entered into the database beforehand. Users could also see recipes previously added by other users.
